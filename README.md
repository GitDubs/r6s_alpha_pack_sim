I often wondered if the alpha pack rolls in Rainbow Six Seige were actually
accurate to the percentages presented to the player, so I wrote my own script
to determine the average number of games to hit a successful roll

The only assumption I had to make was the rate at which the player wins games,
I figured my friends and I probably average to around 1 win every 3 games, if 
you feel you are better/worse than that simply adjust games_per_win variable

DISCLAIMER:
I am not a dev, I made this simulation to the best of my understanding of the 
alpha pack system as of 04/09/2020
